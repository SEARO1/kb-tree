## Entries

### 2026-06-01 · Initial modification log created
**Status:** Added
**Files:** `Project.md` (new file)
**Why:** The project is growing in scope. A persistent log helps keep track
of what was changed, why, and any mistakes to avoid repeating.
**What:** Created this `Project.md` file as the canonical record of
modifications going forward.
**Notes / Mistakes:** None yet — first entry.

### 2026-06-01 · Click-to-highlight feature
**Status:** Added
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User requested the ability to click a node or edge to highlight the
node/line together with its related ancestors/descendants (for nodes) or
its two endpoints (for edges), and dim/hide the rest of the graph. Only one
selection at a time; clicking the same element again toggles it off.
**What:**
- Added two state vars in `CanvasInner`: `selectedNodeId` and
  `selectedEdgeId` (only one is non-null at a time).
- Built `childrenMap` and `ancestorsMap` via `useMemo`, derived from the
  laid-out edges (BFS up to collect ancestors for every node).
- Added `collectDescendants(startId)` (BFS downward, memoized via
  `useCallback`).
- Computed `clickHighlightedNodeIds` and `clickHighlightedEdgeIds` from
  the current selection.
- Wired `onNodeClick`, `onEdgeClick`, and `onPaneClick` handlers:
  - Click node → set `selectedNodeId` (clears any edge selection).
  - Click same node again → toggle off.
  - Click edge → set `selectedEdgeId` (clears any node selection).
  - Click empty pane → clear both.
- Applied visual styles:
  - Highlighted node: cyan background (`#cffafe`) + cyan border
    (`#06b6d4`) + glow box-shadow. If also a search hit, keeps the yellow
    border (`#0e7490`) accent.
  - Highlighted edge: keeps its original method color, full opacity,
    bumped `strokeWidth` to 3.
  - Dimmed (non-highlighted while a selection is active): `opacity: 0.15`
    for nodes, `opacity: 0.1` for edges.
  - MiniMap shows highlighted nodes in cyan as well.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- Pre-existing build warnings in `App.tsx` and `parseKB.ts`
  (`useMemo`/`rawJson`/`compareEdgeLabel`/`layoutActionGraph` unused) —
  not touched; will surface when `CI=true`.
- `useState` was briefly unused after import; resolved once the new state
  vars were added.
- The BFS-upward ancestor computation handles nodes with multiple parents
  correctly (set-based dedup).
- No state lift to `App.tsx` — selection is purely a `Canvas`-level
  concern. If a future feature needs cross-component awareness, this will
  need to move up.

### 2026-06-01 · Node-click dimming → full hide (match line-click)
**Status:** Modified
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User feedback — the dimming-via-`opacity: 0.15` for non-selected
nodes (and `0.1` for non-selected edges) still left them visible as ghosts.
User wanted node-click to behave exactly like line-click: hide everything
non-essential, only show the relevant nodes/edges.
**What:**
- Replaced the per-node/per-edge `.map` + opacity style with a `.filter`
  step that drops non-selected items entirely when a click selection is
  active. Now both node-click and edge-click render the same minimal
  "essential" subgraph.
- Removed the now-unused `isDimmed` variable and `style: { opacity }`
  branches from the render path.
- Animation is also forced off for highlighted edges to keep the look
  consistent.
- MiniMap stroke-width bumped to 2 to keep the cyan nodes visible at
  minimap scale.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- Side effect: search-hits that are NOT part of the click selection are
  also hidden while a click selection is active. This is intentional
  (matches the "show only essential" rule) and reverts when the selection
  is cleared.
- Build + ESLint both clean.

### 2026-06-01 · Remove node-click highlight (KB tree architecture)
**Status:** Removed
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** After reconsidering the feature in light of the KB-tree
architecture, the user decided node-click highlight doesn't fit. Only
edge-click highlight is kept.
**What:** Removed the node-click surface area from `CanvasInner`:
- `selectedNodeId` state (and all references in `clickHighlightedNodeIds`,
  `clickHighlightedEdgeIds`, `handleEdgeClick`, `handlePaneClick`).
- The `childrenMap` / `ancestorsMap` BFS lookup and `collectDescendants`
  callback (only used for node-click ancestors/descendants).
- The `selectedNodeId` branches in `clickHighlightedNodeIds` and
  `clickHighlightedEdgeIds` memos.
- `handleNodeClick` callback.
- `onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}` prop on `<ReactFlow>`.

Kept (untouched): edge-click logic, search highlight, layout, mini-map,
search-centering, connection handling, all CSS. No other files modified.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- The cyan node-style branch in the render is still there because it now
  applies to the two endpoint nodes of a selected edge (instead of an
  arbitrary node's ancestors/descendants). It was renamed in the inline
  comment to reflect that.
- Build verified clean.

### 2026-06-01 · Edge-click highlight: hide → transparent
**Status:** Modified
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User feedback — when an edge is selected, the previous behavior
was to filter out (hide) all non-selected nodes and edges, leaving only
the two endpoint nodes and the selected edge. The user now wants the
non-selected items to remain visible as ghosts, just rendered
transparent, while the highlighted items keep their full color.
**What:**
- Removed the `.filter(node => !clickActive || clickHighlightedNodeIds!.has(node.id))`
  pre-`.map` step on the nodes array. Now every node is passed through
  `.map`; the click-active + non-highlighted branch applies
  `opacity: 0.15` to the existing style instead.
- Removed the analogous `.filter(...)` on the edges array. The
  non-highlighted-while-click-active branch applies `opacity: 0.1` to
  the edge style instead.
- The cyan endpoint highlight and the `strokeWidth: 3` / `opacity: 1`
  treatment for the selected edge are unchanged.
- Search-hit styling is also unchanged; when click is active and a node
  is NOT part of the click selection, it now shows as a low-opacity
  ghost (search-hit color overridden by transparency) — this matches
  the "show only essential at full opacity" rule.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- MiniMap and the rest of the canvas are untouched, so MiniMap still
  shows the full graph in full color regardless of click selection.
- The `baseStyle` spread on non-highlighted nodes is now `node.style`
  (was `edge.style` for edges only) — kept the spread so any future
  per-node styles aren't clobbered.

### 2026-06-02 · First-intent (entry-point) marker + MiniMap highlight
**Status:** Added
**Files:** `src/components/parseKB.ts`, `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User wanted a visual "arrow" on the entry-point intent of the
KB flow (the first/root intent — e.g. the `Welcome Message` intent in
`WeLab_WeLab-2025-05-07-madojxd9_KB_2026-05-27_13_22_01.json`,
`intentId: 1d6d957a`, `parentId: "ROOT"`, `sortOrder: 1`), and to
specifically call out that node in the MiniMap.
**What:**
- In `parseKB.ts`:
  - Added a `pickFirstIntentId(sortedIntents)` helper. It prefers the
    root intent (parentId `'ROOT'` / `null`) with the lowest
    `sortOrder`; falls back to the first intent overall; returns
    `null` only when the list is empty.
  - Each pushed node now carries `data.isFirstIntent: true` on the
    one node picked, and its label is prefixed with `▶ ` so the
    "arrow" is visible inside the node card.
  - Extended the `FlowNode` data type with the optional
    `isFirstIntent?: boolean` field (TS errored on an unknown prop
    until I added it).
- In `Canvas.tsx`:
  - New `firstIntentNodeId` `useMemo` derived from `initialNodes`
    (the one whose `data.isFirstIntent` is true).
  - In the per-node style map, added a new branch **below** the
    click-highlight and search-hit branches so those keep priority.
    The first-intent treatment is: gold background (`#fef3c7`),
    amber border (`#f59e0b`, 2px), `boxShadow` glow
    (`0 0 0 4px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.25)`), `zIndex: 10`. The base
    style spread was added on each branch so the new style doesn't
    clobber any future per-node inline styles.
  - The MiniMap `nodeColor` callback now returns `#f59e0b` (amber)
    for `firstIntentNodeId` — placed first, so it wins over search
    / click / type-based colors.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- The entry-point branch is intentionally **last** in the node
  style chain (after click-highlight and search-hit). So if a node
  is both a click-highlighted endpoint and the first intent, the
  cyan click style wins; if a node is both a search hit and the
  first intent, the yellow search style wins. The first-intent
  amber only shows on a "normal" first-intent node. This matches
  the existing layering convention.
- "First intent" detection is purely static — it doesn't follow
  outgoing edges. If a KB has multiple root intents (no incoming


### 2026-06-02 · Make the MiniMap draggable to pan the main canvas
**Status:** Added
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User wanted to be able to click-and-drag the MiniMap to
pan the main canvas. By default, in `@xyflow/react` v12 (this
project uses `^12.10.2`), the MiniMap's `pannable` and `zoomable`
props default to `false` — so dragging inside the minimap did
nothing on the main view.
**What:** Added two props to the `<MiniMap />` element in
`Canvas.tsx`:
- `pannable` — when true, dragging inside the minimap pans the
  main viewport accordingly.
- `zoomable` — when true, scrolling inside the minimap zooms the
  main viewport. Pairs naturally with `pannable` and is the same
  two-prop pattern the React Flow docs recommend for an
  interactive minimap.
**Notes / Mistakes:**
- No code-level work was needed: `pannable` and `zoomable` are
  built-in `MiniMap` props (see
  `node_modules/@xyflow/react/dist/esm/additional-components/MiniMap/types.d.ts:69-77`),
  so I didn't need a custom `onClick` handler or any coordinate
  math.
- The MiniMap's existing node-color logic (first-intent amber,
  search yellow, click cyan, type-based) is unchanged — it still
  drives the dot colors while the user drags.
- `position` is left at the default (`PanelPosition.BottomRight`).
  If the user later wants the minimap on a different corner, it's
  a one-line change.
- No need to add a custom cursor style — React Flow swaps to
  `grab`/`grabbing` automatically when `pannable` is on.

## To-Do

### 2026-06-02 · Re-add node-click highlight (immediate parent + all immediate children)
**Status:** Pending — user has a higher-priority task to finish first.
**Files:** `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
**Why:** User requested re-introducing node-click highlight that was removed
in the 2026-06-01 "Remove node-click highlight (KB tree architecture)" entry.
The new behavior should mirror the existing edge-click pattern (full color
on essentials, transparent on the rest) but for a node and its **single
immediate parent** + **all immediate children**.

**Spec (clicked node = `X`):**
- Highlighted nodes: `X` itself + `X`'s immediate parent + every immediate
  child of `X` (0, 1, or many).
- Highlighted edges: `X`↔parent edge + `X`↔each-child edge.
- All other nodes: `opacity: 0.15`.
- All other edges: `opacity: 0.1`.
- Click same node again → toggle off.
- Click empty pane → clear all selections (`selectedNodeId` and
  `selectedEdgeId`).
- Click node while edge is selected → switch to node selection (clear
  `selectedEdgeId`).
- Click edge while node is selected → switch to edge selection (clear
  `selectedNodeId`).
- Existing edge-click behavior is preserved unchanged.

**Worked examples (using the project's reference tree):**
- Click `C` → highlight `A`, `C`, `F`; edges `A-C`, `C-F`.
- Click `B` → highlight `A`, `B`, `E`; edges `A-B`, `B-E`.
- Click `E` → highlight `B`, `E`, `H`, `I`; edges `B-E`, `E-H`, `E-I`.
- Click root `A` → highlight `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`; edges `A-B`, `A-C`, `A-D`
  (no parent).
- Click leaf `H` → highlight `E`, `H`; edge `E-H` (no children).

**Implementation sketch (for when we resume):**
- Re-add `selectedNodeId` state in `CanvasInner` (mutually exclusive with
  `selectedEdgeId`).
- Build `childrenMap` and `parentMap` via `useMemo` from the laid-out edges.
  `parentMap` can be `Map<nodeId, nodeId>` (tree case) — the project's
  reference tree has exactly 1 parent per non-root node, so single-parent
  is the assumption. Flag for the user if the live data is a graph with
  multi-parent nodes.
- Compute `clickHighlightedNodeIds` / `clickHighlightedEdgeIds` from
  `selectedNodeId`.
- Re-add `handleNodeClick` and wire `onNodeClick` on `<ReactFlow>`.
- Make `handlePaneClick` clear both selections.
- Reuse the existing cyan endpoint node style for highlighted nodes.
- MiniMap stays unchanged (full graph in full color) — consistent with
  the current edge-click behavior.

**Notes / Mistakes:**
- Search-hit styling (yellow border) is layered on top and remains
  unchanged. A node that is both a search hit and a click selection will
  keep its yellow border accent (per the existing accent branch).
- A node with **multiple parents** is not covered by the reference tree
  and was not explicitly clarified — assume single-parent for now and
  surface the question when we resume.
- Toggle-off behavior: clicking the same node twice in a row should
  clear the selection (matches the existing edge-click toggle pattern).

### 2026-06-02 · Hub-splitting for dense intent nodes (splitter pattern) — implemented
**Status:** Added
**Files:** `src/components/parseKB.ts` (new `splitHubNodes` + tests),
`src/components/Canvas.tsx` (splitter visuals + click-to-jump),
`src/App.tsx` (toggle + re-derivation), `src/App.css` (toggle style).
**Why:** The design review entry below (2026-06-02 "Hub-splitting … design
review") was approved with these decisions from the user:
1. The original hub is **hidden** (removed from the visible node list).
2. First-intent / search / click-highlight metadata is **propagated to
   the splitters** so the visual treatment survives the split.
3. Splitter chains are **not** added as real directed edges; the only
   "internal" edge is a single bridge `in-last → out-first` per hub to
   keep the graph connected. Bridge edges are flagged
   `isSplitterBridge: true` and excluded from in/out-degree counts so
   the algorithm is non-recursive.
4. `checkAllIntentsAdded` runs against the **pre-split** graph.
5. Trigger threshold **≥ 6** (configurable via `SplitHubOptions`).
6. **"Splitters: On/Off" toggle** in the top bar (defaults to On).
7. **In-source smoke tests** in `parseKB.ts` (run on module load in dev).

**What:**
- `parseKB.ts`:
  - Added `SplitHubOptions` and exported `splitHubNodes(nodes, edges, options?)`.
    Pure: returns new `{ nodes, edges }`; never mutates input.
  - Each splitter node carries `data.isVirtual: true`,
    `data.parentHubId: <hubId>`, `data.hubSide: 'in' | 'out'`,
    `type: 'splitter'`. Initial positions are staggered
    (`x: ±300 * idx`, `y: ±300`) so ELK doesn't pile them at origin.
  - Bridge edge style: dashed gray, `strokeWidth: 1`, low opacity when
    no click selection is active.
  - `FlowNode.data` extended with the optional `isVirtual` / `parentHubId`
    / `hubSide` fields. `FlowEdge` extended with the optional
    `isSplitterBridge` flag.
  - Added 5 in-source smoke tests at the bottom of the file: low-fanout
    passthrough, hub triggered and hidden, label/style preservation,
    idempotence under re-application, and the `enabled: false` no-op.
    Tests run on module load in dev (`process.env.NODE_ENV !==
    'production'`) and log `[splitHubNodes] in-source tests passed`.
- `Canvas.tsx`:
  - New state `splitterFocusHubId` for the click-to-jump navigation.
  - `handleNodeClick` sets/clears the focus when a splitter is clicked;
    real intent nodes clear the focus.
  - `useEffect` pans/zooms the viewport to fit all splitters of the
    focused hub.
  - New render branch for `isVirtual` nodes: dashed border, lighter
    background, italic label. Focused splitter gets a stronger cyan
    dashed border. Splitters of the first-intent hub inherit the amber
    treatment via the new `firstIntentStyleNodeIds` set.
  - Bridge edges render as soft dashed lines, lower opacity than real
    edges; fully transparent when a click selection is active.
  - MiniMap: virtual nodes render gray; the focused hub's splitters
    render cyan.
  - `onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}` wired on `<ReactFlow>`.
- `App.tsx`:
  - Split state into `rawNodes` / `rawEdges` (post-parse, pre-split) and
    `nodes` / `edges` (rendered, post-split). The `useEffect` re-derives
    the rendered graph from the raw one whenever the toggle flips.
  - `checkAllIntentsAdded` is called with `parsedNodes` (pre-split).
  - New button `Splitters: On/Off` in the top bar, only visible after a
    JSON is loaded.
- `App.css`: added `.splitter-toggle` (and `.on` / `.off` variants).

**Notes / Mistakes:**
- Pre-existing build warnings (`compareEdgeLabel`, `layoutActionGraph`,
  `rawJson`) finally surfaced under `CI=true`. Each now carries an
  `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` to
  preserve the "not touched" status from the earlier design review.
- **Layout caveat:** splitters with ≥ 6 connections add 1 layer each
  in the ELK layout (one bridge edge per hub adds 1 more). For a graph
  that was 8 layers deep, a 6-fanout hub can push the layout to 10
  layers. The staggered initial positions prevent the
  all-splitters-at-origin pile-up seen in the first run, but
  layout-stability on user-dragged nodes is still a known limitation
  (re-running ELK resets drag positions).
- **Edge-click highlight after splitting:** clicking the (now many)
  edges of a split hub highlights only the chosen edge and its two
  endpoints. The user has to click multiple edges to traverse the
  full path through the hub. This is the expected trade-off — the
  alternative (treating the original edge as a "virtual group") would
  need new state and a new rendering path; deferred.
- **Splitter click-to-jump is a viewport fit, not a true "navigate
  between views"** — both sides of a hub are on the same canvas; the
  effect just pans to a fitting rectangle of all siblings. This is the
  simplest interpretation of the user's "jump to other F'" wording.
- The in-source tests are intentionally minimal. A proper Jest harness
  (e.g. `parseKB.test.ts` with `describe` / `it`) would let CI verify
  regressions; the current run-on-load approach is a stopgap.

### 2026-06-02 · Hub-splitting for dense intent nodes (splitter pattern)
**Status:** Pending — design review
**Files:** `src/components/parseKB.ts` (new exported `splitHubNodes`
function), `src/App.tsx` (call it after `parseKBToGraph`).
**Why:** Some intent nodes in real KB JSON have a very high fanout
(many incoming or outgoing edges), which makes the ELK layered layout
produce a lot of edge crossings and makes the canvas hard to read.
The data is correct — only the visual is too dense.

**Concept (splitter pattern):**
For any node `H` whose effective in-degree or out-degree exceeds a
threshold, insert intermediate "splitter" nodes `H'_a`, `H'_b`, … and
route the connections through them. Each splitter receives/forwards
at most `maxFanout` real edges, and the splitters are connected to each
other in a chain so the layout shows them as a clearly-belonging
group.

**Concrete rules (user-confirmed):**
- Trigger: in-degree > 3 **or** out-degree > 3 ⇒ split.
- Limit: 3 connections per splitter (configurable via a `maxFanout`
  option; default 3).
- Incoming and outgoing splitters are **separate** node sets. A node
  with both 7 incoming and 7 outgoing edges will have an incoming
  group `H'_in_*` and an outgoing group `H'_out_*` independently.
- Inter-splitter topology: **chain** (`H'_1 → H'_2 → H'_3`).
- The chain edges are flagged (e.g. `data.isSplitterBridge: true` on
  the edge) and **excluded from the in/out-degree count**, so the
  splitters themselves never trigger another split.
- Single level of splitting only — the algorithm is intentionally
  non-recursive. Once a hub is split, the splitters stay.
- Scope: applies only to the action-based graph
  (`parseKBFormatActions`). The parentId fallback parser and the legacy
  generic tree are left alone.

**Edge rewiring example** (incoming, 7 → 3):
```
Before: A,B,C,D,E,F,G ─► H
After:  A,B,C ─► H'_in_1 ─┐
         D,E,F ─► H'_in_2 ─┼─► H
                G ─► H'_in_3 ─┘
         (chain: H'_in_1 → H'_in_2 → H'_in_3)
```
And symmetrically for outgoing fanout (the `H ─► H'_out_*` side).

**Implementation sketch (Option C — separate function):**
- New exported `splitHubNodes(nodes, edges, options?)` in
  `parseKB.ts`. Pure: returns new `{ nodes, edges }`, does not mutate.
- Internally:
  1. Build `incoming` / `outgoing` maps from real edges (skip
     `isSplitterBridge` edges).
  2. Pass through each node; if `incoming > maxFanout`, partition
     incoming edges into chunks of ≤ `maxFanout`, create
     `ceil(incoming / maxFanout)` incoming-splitter nodes, rewire the
     edges, and add the chain bridge edges.
  3. Same for outgoing.
  4. New edge IDs are derived as
     `splitterId‖originalTargetId` (and `originalSourceId‖splitterId`)
     to avoid React Flow duplicate-key warnings. Original label,
     method color, and style are preserved.
- Splitter node metadata:
  - `type: 'splitter'` (or any new React Flow node type — coordinate
    with Canvas.tsx if a custom render is desired).
  - `data.isVirtual: true` and a label like `"splitter"` or
    `"<hubId> in splitter"`.
  - `data.parentHubId: <original hub id>` so future features can
    collapse the splitters back if needed.
- Wire-up in `App.tsx:17` `handleJsonLoaded`:
  ```ts
  const { nodes: parsedNodes, edges: parsedEdges } = parseKBToGraph(data);
  const { nodes: finalNodes, edges: finalEdges } =
    splitHubNodes(parsedNodes, parsedEdges);
  setNodes(finalNodes);
  setEdges(finalEdges);
  ```
  (Wrapping the `splitHubNodes` call in a future UI toggle is a
  one-line change.)

**Visual style for splitters (TBD when implementing):**
- Default: dashed border + lighter background, same dimensions as
  intent nodes. No emoji / no label clutter. This is a low-priority
  decision — can be polished later.

**Notes / Mistakes:**
- Edge-case: a hub with both 7 incoming and 7 outgoing will get
  `ceil(7/3)=3` incoming-splitters and 3 outgoing-splitters ⇒ 6
  virtual nodes around it. That's acceptable for a hub, but worth
  noting.
- Edge-case: parallel edges (already collapsed in
  `parseKBFormatActions` via the `adjacency` map) — splitting must
  operate on the post-collapse graph, so the splitter's one edge
  inherits the merged `labels` and `methods` of the original
  multi-edge. Confirmed in the existing code at
  `parseKB.ts:230-242`.
- Edge-case: a splitter with exactly 0 connections after a future
  edit. The current algorithm only creates splitters that will
  receive/forward at least 1 edge, so this shouldn't happen, but
  worth a safety filter.
- The function is not yet unit-tested; recommend a small
  in-source test in `parseKB.ts` or a follow-up entry if
  `App.test.tsx` is the chosen harness.
- This entry is **design-only** — implementation is gated on the
  user reviewing and approving this spec.
